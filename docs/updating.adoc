directly update your Vagrant box. In some cases, you will need to
perform a clean installation or follow additional steps to complete the
update.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

. If ADB is running, run the vagrant halt command:
+
....
# vagrant halt
....

. Delete the virtual machine with the vagrant destroy command. This
action will also delete any data or configuration in your ADB that is
not saved on your host machine:
+
....
# vagrant destroy
....

[[update-from-atlas-hashicorp]]
== Update ADB from atlas.hashicorp.com

If you use ADB images from atlas.hashicorp.com, you can perform a direct
update of the Vagrant boxes.

. Run the following command to check if a newer version of the box is
available:
+
....
# vagrant box outdated
....

. If a newer version is available, the output should look like this:
+
....
Checking if box 'projectatomic/adb' is up to date...
A newer version of the box 'projectatomic/adb-testing' is available! You
currently have version '1.3.1'. The latest is version '1.3.2'. Run `vagrant
box update` to update.
....

. If you see the above output, update the ADB Vagrant image with this
command:
+
....
# vagrant box update
....

[[update-from-cloud-centos]]
== Update ADB from cloud.centos.org

If you use ADB images from cloud.centos.org, you must manually remove
the previously-installed boxes from your host machine and perform a
clean installation.

. Monitor the mailing list and other announcement points to determine
if a new image is available.

. Download the latest image and perform a clean install as described
in the link:installing.adoc[installation documentation].
