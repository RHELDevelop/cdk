== Installation and Update

This section contains issues related to installing, configuring, and updating ADB.

=== On a Windows machine, Vagrant fails to initialize after updating to the latest ADB version

In addition to the standard link:updating.adoc[steps to update ADB], you need to run the
following command to delete the .vagrant.d directory:

----
# rm -rf C:/Users/<user_name>/.vagrant.d/
----

[[landrrush]]
== Landrush

https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush/blob/master/README.md[Landrush] is a
platform-agnostic DNS server used by ADB to provide name based access to services,
such as Openshift, running in ADB.

In ADB, you use Landrush as a vagrant plugin. Refer to the
link:installing.adoc[Installation document] for details on downloading
Landrush.


=== I am unable to access the Internet or override the Landrush upstream DNS

By default, Landrush uses Google's DNS server, with the IP address
8.8.8.8, to resolve DNS queries that are not for Landrush managed
hostnames. If your network blocks access to the Google DNS servers, due
to firewalls, VPN and so on, you need to set a custom upstream DNS
server. This server is configured with the `config.landrush.upstream`
option.

For example, to use 10.25.35.4 as a DNS server, add this line to your
`Vagrantfile`:

`config.landrush.upstream '10.25.35.4'`

You will need to check your network configuration on the host or ask your
network administrator for the right DNS server address to use.

For further details, refer to the *Guest is unable to access the Internet* and
the *Unmatched Queries* sections in the https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush/blob/master/README.md[Landrush documentation].


=== I cannot access the OpenShift console from my browser

Landrush enables you to access services running in ADB, such as
OpenShift, from the browser. When you start ADB, it provides Landrush
with the IP address and the hostname it wishes to use. Landrush always
uses the latest information available. Occasionally, using multiple
copies of ADB on the same host or other problems with ADB can cause
Landrush to store stale data in the `hosts.json` file, which prevents
access to the OpenShift console. +

There are two ways you can remove these stale entries, you can do the
following:

. Use `vagrant landrush ls` to check the existing domains for Landrush.
. Use `vagrant  landrush del <domain_name>` to delete the unwanted
domains.

Alternatively, you can:

. Run `vagrant destroy` to destroy the ADB vagrant box.
+
WARNING: Using vagrant destroy will destroy any data you stored in the Vagrant box.
You will not be able to restart this instance and will have to create a new one using `vagrant up`.

. Delete extra entries from the `hosts.json` file :

  * Windows users will find this file in: `C:/Users/<USER>/.vagrant.d/data/landrush/hosts.json`
  * Linux and OS X users will find this file in: `~/.vagrant.d/data/landrush/hosts.json`
+
The `hosts.json` file should now have an empty list of hostnames,
represented by a file containing only curly braces `{}`.

To verify that your hostname has been correctly registered with Landrush,
run `vagrant up`. The expected output is:

....
$ vagrant.exe landrush ls
cdk.vm                         172.28.128.3
3.128.28.172.in-addr.arpa      cdk.vm
cdk                            cdk.vm
....


=== OpenShift Web console fails to reconnect when you switch networks or reconnect to VPN

Linux users are most likely to encounter this problem because
**NetworkManager** overwrites Landrushâ€™s entry in the `/etc/resolve.conf` file, on enterprise Linux. The **NetworkManager** controls the
`/etc/resolve.conf` file. When you connect to a VPN network or switch
networks (for example, from a work network to a home network),
**NetworkManager** overwrites this file and the Landrush entry is deleted.

To resolve this you need to add the following lines, at the top of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file:

....
# Added by landrush, a vagrant plugin
nameserver 127.0.0.1
....


=== I use libvirt and am unable to connect to the OpenShift console or the other applications running in ADB, or I use Libvirt but want to use VirtualBox for ADB

Linux users may be affected by this issue. If you use libvirt provider,
`libvirtd` uses `dnsmasq` as part of it's internal DNS resolution for
virtual machines. When Landrush starts, it expects to be able to reset
the system `dnsmasq`. The libvirt started `dnsmasq` blocks this action.
Therefore, it is important that the system `dnsmasq` be started before
libvirt.

Perform these steps to resolve this issue:

NOTE: The following steps must be run as root.

. Stop the libvirt and dnsmasq process:
+
....
$ systemctl stop libvirtd
$ systemctl stop dnsmasq
....

. Kill the dnsmasq process running on the host:
+
....
$ ps aux | grep dnsmasq
$ kill -9 <pid>
$ ps aux | grep dnsmasq
....
+
Or you could:
+
....
$ killall -9 dnsmasq
....

. Start the dnsmasq process first and then start the libvirt process.
+
....
$ systemctl start dnsmasq
$ systemctl status dnsmasq
$ systemctl start libvirtd
$ systemctl status libvirtd
....
+
[NOTE]
====
If you wish to use the VirtualBox provider, start the dnsmasq process
only and skip the start libvirt process:
....
$ systemctl start dnsmasq
$ systemctl status dnsmasq
....
====

. Now, `vagrant up`.
+
....
$ vagrant up
....
