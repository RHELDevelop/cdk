= Atomic Developer Bundle
:toc:
:toc-placement!:

Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB) is a prepackaged development environment
filled with production-grade, pre-configured tools, that makes container
developers' lives easier. ADB supports the development of
multi-container applications against different technologies and
orchestrators while providing a path that promotes best practices.

[[advantages]]
== Advantages of ADB

As a container developer, you want to use ADB for these reasons:

* **Pre-Configured**: You don't have to spend time building an
environment and fighting configuration battles.

* **Multiple Environment Support**: ADB works on Windows, Linux and Mac
OS X. ADB supports several orchestrators (OpenShift, Kubernetes, Mesos,
and plain Docker). ADB is language independent and supports multiple
developer models (IDE, CLI, SSH containment).

* **Production-Grade**: The components of ADB are configured to behave
just as they will in production. Containers promise seamless delivery,
but only if you test them in the right environment. This is that
environment.

* **Self-Contained**: ADB is ready to go once installed. It comes
prepackaged with the most common components ready, in case they are
needed.

* **Open Source**: ADB leverages existing tools and technologies
wherever possible to avoid pushing a developer into an environment that
won't be supportable in production or that is tied to a single vendor.
This also means it benefits from the stability of existing projects
instead of reinventing the wheel.

ADB is a virtual machine that is executed with Vagrant and some Vagrant
plugins.

[[when-to-use]]
== When would ADB typically be used?

A developer begins using ADB, in most cases, once they have a working
application that has been decomposed into micro-services. They then
follow this general outline of steps:

. Consider ways to divide your application into its component services
or micro-services. For standard pieces, such as web servers, consider
using pre-built containers from trusted sources. For truly unique
pieces, build a custom container.

. Confirm the application works in ADB by manually launching the
application's container components or by using the instance of OpenShift
in the container to launch the application.

. Build orchestration configurations that provide scaling and other
required features, or complete the OpenShift application configuration.
Alternatively, build a Nulecule description of the application.

. Test the application.

The http://docs.projectatomic.io/container-best-practices/[Container
Best Practices] document in this project may also be of interest.

[[typical-usage-pattern]]
== What is the typical usage pattern?

ADB supports three basic modes of usage. The modes vary by how much they
rely on tools on the developer's workstation. From most to least
reliant, they are:

* Host-based IDE Mode
+
This mode uses ADB as a server resource for host-based IDE tools. In
this mode, the user will run `eclipse` or other IDE tools that will
access the resources of ADB.

* Host-based CLI Mode
+
This mode uses ADB as a server resource for host-based CLI tools. In
this mode, the user will run `docker` and other CLI tools on their
workstation and the result will be containers executed inside of ADB.

* SSH Mode
+
This mode uses ADB as a Linux virtual machine. The user will use the
`ssh` command to log into ADB and will directly execute `docker` and
other commands from the command line. This is similar to having
installed a Linux virtual machine and then installing and configuring
all of the software ADB ships with.

More information about link:docs/using.adoc[using ADB] is available.

[[adb-related-projects]]
== What does ADB utilize?

ADB is built on top of https://www.centos.org/[CentOS 7] and the
following projects:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]: container runtime and packaging

* https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic/[Atomic CLI]: container usage
assistance

* http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]: container orchestration

* http://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift Origin]: a next generation PaaS
for docker containers

* https://github.com/projectatomic/openshift2nulecule/[openshift2nulecule]:
a tool that creates a Nulecule application from an existing OpenShift
project

* https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/[Mesos Marathon]: a
production-grade container orchestration platform for Mesosphere's
Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) and Apache Mesos

ADB supports https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/[Atomic App], an
implementation of the multi-container application specification
https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/[nulecule], for
multi-container applications.

You need to use the customized Vagrantfiles provided in ADB project to
set up the above mentioned environments. For further details refer to
the Installation steps in the next section.

[[quick-install-run]]
== How do I install and run ADB?

Below is an installation overview using the most common options.
Detailed link:docs/installing.adoc[installation instructions] are
available.

. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Install VirtualBox] for
your operating system.

. https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html[Install
Vagrant] for your operating system.

. Install the https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager[vagrant-service-manager],
https://github.com/dustymabe/vagrant-sshfs[vagrant-sshfs], and https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush[landrush]
Vagrant plugins.
+
----
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager vagrant-sshfs landrush
----
Some operating systems may need additional dependencies to be
installed before you proceed with the installation of the vagrant
plugins. For details refer to the detailed
link:docs/installing.adoc[Installation document].

. Download the customized Vagrantfiles provided by the ADB project.
These Vagrantfiles will download ADB and automatically set up
provider-specific container development environments. They are listed
below and more details are available in the
link:docs/installing.adoc[Installation document].
+
To download ADB and set up a provider-specific container development
environment:
+
.. Create a directory for the Vagrant box.
+
----
$ mkdir directory && cd directory
----

.. Download any of the following vagrantfiles, to configure the
development environment you need.
* To configure a
https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/components/centos/centos-docker-base-setup/Vagrantfile[Docker
specific container development environment] use:
+
----
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/master/components/centos/centos-docker-base-setup/Vagrantfile > Vagrantfile
----
* To configure a

----

. Start ADB.
+
----
vagrant up
----
+
This will download ADB and set it up to work with the provider of
choice, for use with host-based tools or via `vagrant ssh`. You may wish
to review the link:docs/using.adoc[Using Atomic Developer Bundle]
documentation before starting ADB, especially if you are using
host-based tools.

[[included-features]]
== Which features are included?

Currently, the box provides the following:

* Docker support to unsupported platforms (i.e. Microsoft Windows, Mac
OS X, etc.)
* Kubernetes orchestration for local testing of applications
* Application definition using the Nulecule specification

Additional goals, objectives and work in progress can be found on the
Project Atomic https://trello.com/b/j1rEolFe/container-tools[trello
board].

[[deliverables]]
== What are the deliverables and where are they delivered?

ADB is delivered as a Vagrant box for various (currently libvirt and
VirtualBox) providers. The boxes are built using the CentOS powered
https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CommunityBuildSystem[Community Build
System]. Boxes are delivered via
https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search[Hashicorp's Atlas] and are
available at
http://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/vagrant/x86_64/images/[cloud.centos.org].
These boxes differ from existing Vagrant boxes for CentOS as they have
specific build requirements that are not enabled in those boxes.
