= Vagrantfile: Single-Node Kubernetes
:toc:
:toc-placement!:

This Vagrantfile is the suggested configuration for using the CDK with
Kubernetes. This file sets up private networking that will be used to
expose the docker daemon and Kubernetes to the host. This Vagrant file
also sets up a single node Kubernetes instance where the master and node
are on the same machine.

This Vagrantfile is useful for anyone using host-based tools, such as
the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Docker_Tooling[Eclipse
docker tooling] or the kubectl, oc and docker CLIs, with the CDK.

[[quickstart]]
== Quickstart

.  Create a directory for the Vagrant Box.
+
----
$ mkdir directory && cd directory
----
.  Get the latest CDK box and add it to Vagrant. You can download the CDK
and find further information about CDK
http://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/[here]. For detailed instructions on how to install CDK refer to the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-container-development-kit/2.2/paged/installation-guide[CDK Installation Guide].

+
NOTE: The name you assign to the box using the --name parameter in the `$ vagrant box add --name cdkv2 \
  ~/Downloads/rhel-cdk-kubernetes-7.2-*.x86_64.vagrant-libvirt.box` command, must correspond to the name used by the Vagrantfile used to initialize the box. By default, this is cdkv2 for the Vagrantfiles provided with Container Development Kit.

.  Download the vagrantfile.
+
----
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/master/components/rhel/misc/rhel-k8s-singlenode-setup/Vagrantfile > Vagrantfile
----

.  Start the Vagrant Box.
+
----
$ vagrant up
----

.  Proceed with using the CDK box.

== Verifying the installation

You may wish to `vagrant ssh` into the CDK and verify that Kubernetes is
setup using the `kubectl` CLI as follows:

----
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME        LABELS                             STATUS
127.0.0.1   kubernetes.io/hostname=127.0.0.1   Ready
