= Vagrantfile: CentOS Single-Node Kubernetes
:toc:

This Vagrantfile is the suggested configuration for using ADB with
Kubernetes. This file sets up private networking that will be used to
expose the docker daemon and kubernetes to the host. This file also sets
up a single node Kubernetes instance where the master and node are on
the same machine.

This Vagrantfile is useful for anyone using host-based tools, such as
the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Docker_Tooling[Eclipse
docker tooling] or the kubernetes and docker CLIs, with ADB.

[[verifying-the-installation]]
== Verifying the installation

You may wish to `vagrant ssh` into ADB and verify that Kubernetes is
setup using the `kubectl` CLI as follows:

----
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME        LABELS                             STATUS
127.0.0.1   kubernetes.io/hostname=127.0.0.1   Ready
